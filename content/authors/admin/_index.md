My name is Ryan Starr. I have gained experience working within an MSP as a Technical Analyst and through a range of homelab projects. 

I have configured a reverse proxy and VPN to access all of my services remotely from any location. These services include [Nextcloud](https://files.ryanstarr.co.uk) for photo management, [Uptime-Kuma](https://status.ryanstarr.co.uk) for monitoring service uptime and [Wordpress](https://theadventuringdev.com) for hosting my website (this static page is hosted through Netlify), plus many more. These are all run using docker containers and I am in the process of moving them all over to a Kubernetes cluster hosted on Oracle Cloud.
